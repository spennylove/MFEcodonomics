    "At this point, we have the basics of individual instruction and can understand that a \"program\" is a series of instructions.  Programming's real strenghth, however, isn't just running *one* instruction after another like a to-do list.  A program can, in fact, decide to skip instructions, repeat them, or choose one of serveral instructions to run.  In fact, you almost never want your programs to start from the first line of code and execute every line, straight to the end.  **Flow control statements** can decide which instructions to execute under which conditions.\n",
